Communication Final Project
=======
This presentation will focus on the idea of regression and how to perform linear regression modeling in Python enviornment. In the beginning, we will introduce the principle of simple/multiple linear regression, followed by the packages we need to perform linear regression analysis in Python. Next, we will introduce different tests to determine the significance of each predictor variable and set dummies for categorical variables. In the end, we will demonstrate how to interpret those test results and finalize our model.

Packages
=======
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/about/) 

We will use Pandas package and its key data structure which is called the DataFrame to read data.

[Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)

We will use Python’s statsmodels module to implement Ordinary Least Squares(OLS) method of linear regression and perform statistical tests.

Hypothesis Test for Regression Slope

The test focuses on the slope of the regression line

Y = Β0 + Β1X

where Β0 is a constant, Β1 is the slope (also called the regression coefficient), X is the value of the independent variable, and Y is the value of the dependent variable.

If we find that the slope of the regression line is significantly different from zero, we will conclude that there is a significant relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
