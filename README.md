Communication Final Project
=======
This presentation will focus on the idea of regression and how to perform linear regression modeling in Python enviornment. In the beginning, we will introduce the principle of simple/multiple linear regression, followed by the packages we need to perform linear regression analysis in Python. Next, we will introduce different tests to determine the significance of each predictor variable and set dummies for categorical variables. In the end, we will demonstrate how to interpret those test results and finalize our model.
